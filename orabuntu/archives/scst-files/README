#
#	0.	Run these scripts on Ubuntu as the Ubuntu admin install non-root (i.e. the user with 'sudo' privilege);  On CentOS run the scripts as the 'root' user.
#	1.	This SCST Linux SAN for Orabuntu-LXC is installed using the create-scst.sh script which runs the other SCST scripts.
#	2.	The create-scst-oracle.sh script can be run with parameters which you can set in the create-scst.sh file (see below). If you just want SCST and are not going to use
		SCST for an Oracle database, you can edit the create-scst-oracle.sh script to suit your own purposes.
#	3.	If you don't set the parameters for the create-scst-oracle.sh script it is run with default parameters.
#		Those default parameters are as shown below:
#
#	User:     Run this program as root if on RedHat/CentOS/Oracle Linux or similar; Run this program as the install admin user (user with 'sudo' privilege) if on Ubuntu or similar.
#	Usage:    create-scst-oracle.sh com.yourdomain ScstGroupName AsmRedundancy Sysd1SizeGb Data1SizeGb Reco1SizeGb LogicalBlkSiz 
#	Example:  create-scst-oracle.sh com.robinsystems lxc1 external 10G 40G 40G
#
#	Note1:    If you do not pass in a "com.yourdomain" parameter it will be set to default value of com.orabuntu-lxc
#	Note2:    If you do not pass in a "ScstGroupName"  parameter it will be set to default value of lxc1
#	Note3:    If you do not pass in a "AsmRedundancy"  parameter it will be set to default value of external
#	Note4:    If you do not pass in a "Sysd1SizeGb"    parameter it will be set to default value of 1Gb
#	Note5:    If you do not pass in a "Data1SizeGb"    parameter it will be set to default value of 1Gb 
#	Note6:    If you do not pass in a "Reco1SizeGb"    parameter it will be set to default value of 1Gb 
#	Note7:    If you do not pass in a "LogicalBlkSiz"  parameter it will be set to default value of 512 bytes
#
#	4.	You can create the LUNs with 4K logical sector size if desired. The default is 512-byte logical sector size.
#		For the sysd1 sector size for Oracle, 512-byte is the required logical sector size.
#		For the data1 and reco1 the sector size can be 4096-byte (4K) optionally but be aware there are known caveats
#		so be sure you understand these before selecting 4096-byte logical sector sizes.
#	5.	On Ubuntu you may get a mix of actual devices mixed with symlinks in /dev/mapper after reboot.  This is due to some unknown issue in Ubuntu.
#		You can get them all to be symlinks by stopping and starting multipath-tools and flushing the multipaths.  You might have to do this more than once but 1 or 2 cycles is usually 
#		enough to get them all over to symlinks (see example below).
